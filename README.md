# Personal CV Website

This repository hosts the source code for my personal CV website, built with **GitHub Pages**.  
The site serves as a central place to showcase my research background, projects, publications, and interests in robotics.

## About Me

I am a robotics researcher with a strong interest in:

- **Control Systems** (linear, nonlinear, optimal, and learning-based control)
- **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
- **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning** for robotics

My work focuses on building reliable, intelligent robotic systems that operate in complex and uncertain environments.

## Website
